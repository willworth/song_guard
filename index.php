	<p>Song Guard will be a mysql db powered site designed to store song lyrics and chords in a simple, manageable way.  Initially, it will simply store files, but longer term it will sort and present by date added, age of song (if known), artist, title.  There will be additional sections for notes, and a series of check boxes (maybe?) to indicate if it's lyrics only.</p>
