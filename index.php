	<div id= "intro"
	<p>Song Guard is a simple database driven web app to help organise your collection of songs.</p>
	<p>You can organise by artist, song or instrument; by age of song, or how recently you've changed the file.</p>
	<p>There is a separate section for your own material, and design decisions have been made to encourge your creativity.</p>
	</div>

<!-- put js after everything else to ensure that else loads first. 

Song Guard will be a mysql db powered site designed to store song lyrics
	and chords in a simple, manageable way. 
	Initially, it will simply store files,
	but longer term it will sort and present by date added,
	 age of song (if known), artist, title.  
	 There will be additional sections for notes, 
	 and a series of check boxes (maybe?) to indicate if it's lyrics only.
	 I need to add some more text here so I'm free writing until I come
	 up with something useful to add...  Maybe I need to study the database
	 system theory before I begin, or maybe I should just create a basic table
	 to experiment with for the time being.  I don't want that to slow me down
	 too much, and I have just been watching the PHP course, so it would make
	 sense to use it before I forget it all...
